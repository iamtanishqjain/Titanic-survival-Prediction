# Titanic-survival-Prediction

# 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a Survival Machine Learning Model trained to predict survival outcomes based on given input features (such as age, gender, class, and other relevant attributes).

The model achieves an accuracy of ~80%, demonstrating reliable performance for classification tasks.

# 🚀 Features
Preprocessing of raw data (handling missing values, encoding categorical features, normalization).

Model training using supervised learning algorithms.

Achieved 80% accuracy on the test dataset.

Evaluation using confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Easily extendable to other datasets or survival prediction tasks.
